		<center><b>Hardware Promo Video, Martin Guevara, 2019, video</b></center>
    		<p>In 2019, I co-founded a music event called Hardware SF. This was in response to the lack of accessibility to art and dance spaces for queer people of color in the Bay Area. I wear several hats in this organization as I am also the Promotion and Event Coordinator.</p>
