    	<b><i>chaos</i> Martin Guevara, 2020, AR filter</b>
    	<p>This filter was created using AR software to pay homage to the hectic mornings of my last semester of undergrad. As a challenge I would create the assets and the filter within a couple of hours. To many, creating art can be meditative, or calming and rightfully so. And in many cases we create art to confront ourselves. Filters are often created to examine ourself in a different form or light. We use them in images to emphasize our features, and even highlight the dullness that is reality (sometimes). With this filter I wanted to confront my ability to create an artwork but I also wanted to use it as an opportunity to archive the moment of insanity. A snapshot of myself sans filter does not do my emotional/mental state justice.</p>

		<b><i>stop space return</i> Martin Guevara, 2020, VR</b>
			<p><i>stop space return</i>is a VR environment that holds old poetry, selfies, ideas, thoughts, and so on. This space attempts to transcend the idea of a virtual space not as an experience, but as a collection of archived experiences. In my work, I tend to hijack technologies and make way for new uses of them whether they are of utility or not. The idea of archiving comes from a personal and constant need to "keep track". As I upload images and files to an ethereal cloud daily, I certainly wonder of the way they take up space. It's orientation, order, and relevance come to mind. With this piece I conceive an abstract revision of this and meticulous process. </p>

		<b><i>poseNet.mistake</i>Martin Guevara, 2020, poseNet, WEBGL</b>
		<p>poseNet.mistake</p>uses PoseNet which is a vision model that can be used to estimate the pose of a person  in an image or video by estimating where key body joints are. In this example I use the face as a drawing tool, while the colorful cubes act as an ink or paint. I purposely offset the cube as the trail that it leaves behind will cover the face. This project is still in development as I imagine using the the entire body as a tool to draw. This augmented reality piece, reimagines the body as a responsible component for XR (extended reality). The body merges with technology in this sense. To extend the idea of body as a cyborg hybrid, I imagine those who do not have limbs to once again use technology freely without the need of a touch user interface.
