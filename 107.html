    	<b><i>chaos</i>, Martin Guevara, 2020, AR filter</b>
    	<p>Making art in a limited amount of time can make you feel insane. Bananas if you will! And in some cases like mine, it just doesnâ€™t work out too well. But in ANY case there is always something you can do. This Instagram filter is a response to software around me crashing during Mercury in retrograde. I made this filter using Spark AR and was probably completed by 7 am after several renditions.</p>

			<p><i>stop space return</i>is a VR environment where I imagine all of my poems that I write will go. I imagine this VR landscape as a final resting place for my poems. If anything I do not think they will be resting as they are now part of a different world.</p>
