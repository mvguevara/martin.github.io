			<b>Galvanic Skin Response: Best Snack to Bring to an Art Gallery, Martin Guevara, Ying Gao, Emilio Lopez, 2019, Arduino, GSR</b> 
		</center>
		<center>
			<p>In the Human Machine Interface class (Art 106) at SJSU, Emilio, Ying and I created a GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) using Arduino, to determine which snack was best to bring to an art gallery. This question came about when our group originally wanted to understand which snack activated a response from our bodies the most. Our GSR in particular responded to Ying's heartbeat and we used that biodata to determine from four different snacks that trail mix was the most exciting. The Art Gallery part of this piece was referring to our upcoming group show where the three of us offered to bring the snacks that we tested. This piece reflects the silly psuedo-science I am interested in. Although there is no published research that proves this data, I enjoy saying, "Yes, I've researched several snacks and found that trail mix is the best snack to bring to an art gallery opening."

		<b><i>Mirror Glitch</i>Martin Guevara, 2019, Arduino, Processing, modified controller, webcam</b>
		</center>
		
		<center>
			<p><i>Mirror Glitch</i> was an experiment where I modified a controller using a gyroscope and an aceelerometer to create glitched images. The modified controller would connect to any desktop using a webcam via USB, activate said webcam, and would glitch the screen. The user can control the the glitches by changing the orientation of the controller. The lights on the controller indicated the orientation at which it would move the image. The blue light idicated that the image would move along the x-axis and the red light would suggest the image was moving in the y-axis. This experiment was demonstrated at Maker Fair in 2019.</p>
