  <center>Martin is a multidisciplinary artist whose work focuses on intersectionality and indenity. The theory of self-concept plays a major role in their work and allows the viewer to see the work as a type of self-research done by the artist and on the artist. Just as a scientist studies their subjects, Martin studies themself.</center>
