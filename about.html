	<p>Martin Guevara is an artist and pseudo-scientist based in San Jose, California. In his practice, Martin works with video, VR/AR and performative data collection to investigate the peripheries of the everchanging human-machine relationship. The essence of this research focuses on understanding socio-technical and cybernetic processes in which we heavily depend on in the Age of Information and how they can be reenacted. 
In Martin’s recent work, Please Call Now, a toll free number is used to collect data from caller’s dreams. This raw data is then translated and imported into a web-based software to create data visualizations that essentially generate summaries of the users who’ve engaged with the work. The piece is an attempt at utilizing earlier technologies to extract data while reenacting this machine-like process through performance. The core of Please Call Now focuses on questions the general public have regarding the secretive data collection systems that surround our use of modern communication technologies. The work has unfolded in an autonomous way in that it has also evolved into a social experiment and research study. The outcome of this piece is unknown as its natural, self-governing body takes the shape of randomness and relies on engagement and attention from the user. If no one is using the technology does it really even exist?
